Omitting the patterns using the NOT keyword
Use the NOT keyword to select records that don't match the pattern. This query returns all students whose first name does not begin with K.
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE 'K%'
Matching a pattern anywhere using the % wildcard twice
Search for a student in the database where he/she has a K in his/her first name.
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE first_name LIKE '%Q%'
Using the _ wildcard to match pattern at a specific position
The _ wildcard matches exactly one character of any type. It can be used in conjunction with % wildcard. This query fetches all students with letter K at the third position in their first name.
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE first_name LIKE '__K%'
Matching patterns for specific length
The _ wildcard plays an important role as a limitation when it matches exactly one character. It limits the length and position of the matched results. For example -
SELECT * 	 /* Matches first names with three or more letters */
FROM students
WHERE first_name LIKE '___%'

SELECT * 	 /* Matches first names with exactly four characters */
FROM students
WHERE first_name LIKE '____'
